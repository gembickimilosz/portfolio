What is the cyclomatic complexity of the following piece of code?


public static string IntroducePerson(string name, int age)
{
    var response = $"Hi! My name is {name} and I'm {age} years old.";

    if (age >= 18)
        response += " I'm an adult.";

    if (name.Length > 7)
        response += " I have a long name.";

    return response;
}

Answer: 

The cyclomatic complexity of this function is 3.

Simply because:
* Every "if" statement adds one possible path the program can take.
* This function has two "if" statements, plus one default path.

1 (main path) + 1 (if age >= 18) + 1 (if name is long) = 3 total paths
