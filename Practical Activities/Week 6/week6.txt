Review:

This week, I focused on understanding the concept of encapsulation in object-oriented programming. Encapsulation refers to the practice of hiding the internal state of an object and providing access through well-defined interfaces, typically using methods. This helps prevent unintended interference and keeps the object’s behavior predictable and controlled.

I reviewed Section 19.10 in Think Python as suggested, but I noticed that the section doesn’t directly cover encapsulation as a named topic.

To better understand encapsulation, I researched additional examples and reviewed how attributes can be made private using naming conventions (e.g. _attribute or __attribute) and how getter/setter methods or properties can control access. I also practiced writing Python classes that encapsulate data and expose only necessary functionality.

Although the textbook didn’t go into detail on encapsulation in that section, this independent exploration helped reinforce the concept and its practical use in writing more robust, maintainable code.
