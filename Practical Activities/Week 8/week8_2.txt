Baskara et al. (2024) introduced a metamodel aimed at improving object-oriented (OO) design in IoT systems by emphasizing modularity, heterogeneity, and context-awareness. This approach enhances flexibility and scalability, particularly in dynamic environments. A key strength of the model lies in its abstraction of device roles and interactions, aligning well with core OO principles such as encapsulation and inheritance.

However, while effective for passive IoT devices, the original metamodel lacks provisions for active, autonomous agents such as humanoid robots. Specifically, it does not account for the decision-making processes or cognitive behaviors required for autonomous functioning in real-world, human-centric environments.

To address this gap, an extended OO model - referred to here as the Smart Model - is proposed. This model retains the modular structure of Baskara et al.â€™s framework but enhances it by incorporating a CognitiveModule and supporting components. The operational flow is driven by a perceive-plan-act architecture:

Perceive: The robot continuously gathers environmental data via sensors, analyzing the context for potential tasks or triggers.

Plan: If a task is identified, the CognitiveModule formulates an appropriate response or action plan.

Act: Using its actuators, the robot executes the task and monitors the outcome, updating its internal state accordingly.

This activity-based flow reflects real-time, autonomous interaction cycles, enabling adaptive behavior in dynamic settings. By incorporating this behavior-driven architecture, the model extends traditional OO principles into cognitive robotics, making it better suited for complex, autonomous systems.
