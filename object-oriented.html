                <p>Throughout this module, I developed a comprehensive understanding of object-oriented programming and
                    system design, beginning with the fundamentals of Python and progressing through advanced topics
                    such as abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. I learned to critically assess information
                    systems, drawing lessons from case studies involving system failures, and applied this knowledge to
                    create effective UML diagrams - including use case, activity, state machine, and class diagrams - to
                    support system planning. These skills enabled me to design and implement structured, scalable
                    applications in Python. I also gained practical experience with data structures, search algorithms,
                    testing tools, and design patterns,
                    while appreciating the value of sustainable, maintainable code. Overall, the module equipped me with
                    the technical and analytical tools needed to build robust software systems that support business
                    decision-making and operational efficiency.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>In this unit, I had the opportunity to explore the foundational principles of Python
                            programming alongside the key concepts underpinning object-oriented programming (OOP). I
                            examined the evolution of programming paradigms and learned how Python incorporates OOP
                            features such as encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism. Through
                            practical activities and guided readings, I gained hands-on experience with creating Python
                            classes and working with various data types and access modifiers. I also participated in a
                            collaborative discussion, where I reviewed and provided constructive feedback on my peers'
                            contributions, deepening my understanding of OOP concepts through reflection and dialogue.

                        </header>
                        <p>In this unit, I took my first steps into analysing program domains using object-oriented
                            techniques before beginning Python development. I explored how actors interact with software
                            through use case diagrams and learned to model internal system behaviours using state
                            machine diagrams. These tools helped me visualise system functionality and flow, forming a
                            solid foundation for structured software design. I also expanded my understanding of class
                            functions and methods in Python, particularly in relation to variable retention and usage
                            across instances. As part of the ongoing collaborative discussion, I engaged with peers'
                            reflections from Unit 1, offering constructive feedback while deepening my grasp of
                            modelling concepts. This unit was essential in preparing for the design documentation
                            required in the upcoming summative assessment.

                        </header>
                        <p>In this unit, I deepened my understanding of the Unified Modelling Language (UML) as a key
                            tool for representing software systems before implementation. I explored the common syntax
                            used across UML diagrams and learned how different models support various stages of the
                            Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). I designed UML diagrams using open-source tools,
                            which strengthened my ability to visually articulate system architecture and object
                            interactions. This was particularly valuable in preparing for the design document required
                            for the summative assessment. As part of the e-Portfolio activities, I reflected on the
                            relevance of different UML models and created a state machine diagram inspired by a
                            practical example from the core reading. I also continued participating in the collaborative
                            discussion by sharing a summary post that synthesised feedback received from peers, allowing
                            me to refine my earlier contributions and solidify my learning.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>In this unit, I applied my knowledge of UML by experimenting with additional model types,
                            such as class and activity diagrams. I designed a class diagram to represent a specific
                            system and then implemented the corresponding Python program using PyCharm. This practical
                            experience helped solidify my understanding of how design documentation directly informs and
                            shapes the coding process. The unit served as a key milestone in bridging theory with
                            implementation, preparing me for the summative assessment where I will build a working
                            system based on my Week 7 design. I continued building my e-Portfolio by documenting my
                            progress and drafting my final reflection, ensuring I captured the development of my skills
                            and insights throughout the learning process.</p>

                        <p>In this unit, I advanced my understanding of object-oriented programming in Python by
                            exploring how constructors and abstract classes contribute to modular and maintainable code.
                            I examined key concepts such as inheritance, aggregation, composition, and polymorphism, and
                            how they allow for flexible and reusable software design. I also learned about the
                            importance of namespaces and packages in managing variable scope and organising code
                            effectively within distributed teams. Through practical activities, I implemented a Python
                            program using a constructor and abstract class, and worked with example code from the 'Think
                            Python' textbook to reinforce these principles. I recorded my learning and progress in my
                            e-Portfolio, including a reflection on the role of polymorphism in building scalable
                            systems.</p>

                        <p>In this unit, I explored more advanced features of object-oriented programming in Python,
                            focusing on the implementation of abstract classes and interfaces. I learned how interfaces
                            support better code design by promoting modularity, consistency, and reusability across
                            different components of a system. I also examined object-oriented metrics used to evaluate
                            software quality, such as cohesion, coupling, and maintainability. This provided a
                            theoretical foundation for assessing the effectiveness of object-oriented code. Through
                            hands-on activities, I created a Python program applying interfaces and encapsulation,
                            reinforcing the principles of abstraction and clean design. I continued documenting my
                            progress and final reflections in my e-Portfolio, recognising how these concepts directly
                            contribute to the quality and scalability of my future software development work.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>In this unit, I explored essential techniques for improving the quality and functionality of
                            Python programs, focusing on debugging, error handling, and data management. I learned how
                            to identify common coding errors and use Python tools, such as linters and return
                            statements, to debug and maintain high-quality code. I also examined core data
                            structures—including lists, dictionaries, and nested dictionaries—and implemented basic
                            search algorithms to explore stored data efficiently. These concepts are vital for building
                            robust and scalable software solutions. Through e-Portfolio activities, I created a Python
                            program using a nested dictionary within a Car class and applied built-in methods like
                            items(), keys(), and values(). Additionally, I developed a basic design pattern recommender
                            based on user input, using constructors to initialise class attributes. These practical
                            exercises enhanced my understanding of how structured data and program logic contribute to
                            well-designed, object-oriented applications.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>In this unit, I expanded on my knowledge of data structures and focused on how different
                            operations can be applied to sets in Python. I explored key set operations—union,
                            intersection, difference, and symmetric difference—and considered their practical
                            application in real-world scenarios, such as a driverless car system. I also developed an
                            understanding of linear data search techniques and how they can be implemented to retrieve
                            data from various structures efficiently. As part of the practical activity, I revisited
                            recursion and polymorphism by working through selected sections of Think Python. I began
                            contributing to Collaborative Discussion 2, which spans three weeks, and continued building
                            my e-Portfolio by reflecting on how these topics contribute to the effectiveness of data
                            handling and program logic in object-oriented design.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>In this unit, I focused on the final stages of software development—testing and packaging. I
                            learned how to package a Python program for distribution and explored the importance of
                            documentation using the PEP257 convention to ensure that code is readable, maintainable, and
                            professional. I also gained insight into a variety of code testing approaches and explored
                            the tools available in Python to test for quality and robustness. Through the lecturecast
                            and readings, I developed an understanding of how software complexity affects quality and
                            how metrics can be used to assess and improve object-oriented code. These skills are
                            critical for finalising the summative assessment, as they ensure that the codebase is clean,
                            well-documented, and thoroughly tested. I also continued my participation in Collaborative
                            Discussion 2 by responding to peer contributions from Unit 8 and further reflected on these
                            topics in my e-Portfolio.</p>

                        <p>In this unit, I focused on finalising and preparing Python code for stakeholder release by
                            applying key testing and documentation practices. I learned how to write unit tests to
                            validate the functionality of my code and used pylint to ensure that my code adhered to
                            stylistic and formatting standards. This was essential for maintaining both the quality and
                            readability of my scripts. I also explored effective strategies for inline commenting and
                            documenting code to enhance its clarity and usability. These skills are particularly
                            valuable in a professional setting, where clear documentation and thorough testing
                            contribute directly to client satisfaction and code maintainability. I concluded
                            Collaborative Discussion 2 with a summary post reflecting on my own contributions and
                            feedback received, and I continued to build my e-Portfolio with final reflections in
                            preparation for the summative assessment in Week 11.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>In this unit, I explored deeper concepts related to memory management and code architecture
                            within Python. I gained an understanding of how Python simplifies development by abstracting
                            away the need for pointers—unlike languages such as C, which require explicit memory
                            management. This comparison helped me appreciate Python’s role in supporting efficient and
                            sustainable programming. I also investigated design patterns—creational, structural, and
                            behavioural—as a way of organising object-oriented code in reusable and maintainable ways.
                            These patterns provide developers with blueprints to solve common design problems
                            effectively. Additionally, I reflected on the environmental impact of software and how
                            sustainable coding practices, like modular design and efficient resource use, contribute to
                            reducing a system’s carbon footprint. These insights were invaluable in completing the
                            summative system implementation, where I applied design patterns to structure my final
                            Python program. I continued updating my e-Portfolio to document this critical phase of the
                            module.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>In this final unit, I explored how design patterns can be strategically used to structure
                            object-oriented programs, focusing particularly on the factory design pattern. I implemented
                            a Python program that generated objects using this pattern and reflected on how it promotes
                            flexibility and scalability in system architecture. The unit also introduced the concept of
                            combining multiple design patterns within a single codebase, and I examined how certain
                            patterns naturally complement one another when building modular, maintainable systems. This
                            deeper understanding of software architecture has significantly influenced how I approach
                            the organisation of code components and their interactions. Through the readings and seminar
                            discussions, I also considered the role of design patterns in creating sustainable software
                            solutions, reinforcing the environmental and efficiency benefits of thoughtful code
                            structuring. I finalised my e-Portfolio submission by consolidating all reflections and
                            practical work, bringing together the learning journey from this module into one
                            comprehensive record.</p>
