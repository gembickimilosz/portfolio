                <p>By the units mentioned below, I learnt to understand the fundamentals of information systems and
                    critically assess their features and learn from case studies involving systems failures to design
                    purpose-built, successful object-oriented systems via UML diagrams. Such charts include sequence,
                    activity, entity relationship, and class diagrams. Thereafter, I learnt to appreciate the
                    object-oriented programming (OOP)-related principles and leveraged them to develop information
                    systems in both Python and SQL, including a doctor’s surgery-related application. Throughout these
                    endeavours, I learnt how to design and develop object-oriented systems to streamline and inform
                    business decisions.</p>

                            instance, I wrote and shared a post with my colleagues with focus on a failure of an
                            AI-based system that was meant to guide investment decisions, and shared ideas on how such a
                            failure could have been avoided by design.</p>

                        <p>During this unit, I had the chance to apply OOP-related principles in Python further by
                            carrying out coding exercises on encapsulation, polymorphism, including operator overloading
                            for changing the behaviour of built-in Python functions to suit specific custom purposes,
                            and using private (class) attributes and methods. Building on my Java-related knowledge
                            about getters and setters, I had the opportunity to create them in Python in two ways, i.e.,
                            using property decorators and via the ‘property’ built-in function. The codes I developed
                            throughout these exercises can be accessed by clicking 'LEARN MORE' below.</p>

                            in the two previous units and learnt to appreciate UML and its principles at a deeper level.
                            Thus, I was able to slightly update and improve the supermarket-related UML class diagram,
                            which I had created in unit 3. You can see this updated, latest version by clicking ‘LEARN

                            Whilst the class diagram represents all classes in the proposed software system, the
                            sequence diagram illustrates the main steps involved in the process a patient must follow to
                            be able to book an appointment with a doctor. Instead, the activity diagram shows the
                            required checks and operations that a receptionist may perform to book an appointment for a
                            patient.</p>

                        <p>In this unit, I had the opportunity to create a UML 3NF-compliant <a

                                relationship diagram (ERD) on property lettings</a>, which represents the main relevant
                            entities (tables) and their relationships. I also completed an assignment on a software
                            system design to help in managing self-service checkouts at a supermarket, which involves a
                            related UML class diagram, including its classes and their relationships. Click on 'LEARN
                            MORE' below to view this assignment. In this instance, I learnt how to wear the user’s
                            (customer’s) hat and empathise with their pain points to drive the design of the information
                            system based on their needs and operations involved when scanning items at a self-service
                            checkout. This way of thinking enabled me to design the system such that the customer’s
                            experience is as seamless as possible, from the start to the end of this process.
                            Furthermore, I appreciated the lecturer’s feedback and leveraged it as an external reviewer
                            to improve the clarity of the relationships represented on the class diagram, as
                            demonstrated in subsequent units’ artefacts, such as in unit 8.</p>

                        <p>Throughout this unit, I had the opportunity to learn web development using Flask in Python as

                                related exercises</a>. Furthermore, as an assignment, given a UML class diagram, I
                            implemented a Python-based software system focused on leveraging OOP-related design to help
                            in managing a doctor’s surgery’s appointment scheduling’s and prescriptions’ workflows,
                            which can be accessed by clicking 'LEARN MORE' below. In this instance, I practised further
                            on how to understand the patient’s (user’s) journey through the process of booking an
                            appointment and requesting a prescription at a doctor’s surgery. By leveraging the UML class
                            diagram with the expected classes and their relationships, I could appreciate the various
                            interactions and constraints involved in such workflows, and how they can be represented via
                            an object-oriented design and implementation. Thus, I designed the application to leverage
                            OOP-related best practices to streamline the user’s experience and ensure all business and
                            technical requirements were strictly adhered to.</p>

                            being of particular importance for ensuring current and future purposeful adoption of AI
                            technologies to benefit society. Thus, I created a blog post on this theme, which you can
