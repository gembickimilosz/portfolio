                <p>By the units mentioned below, I learnt to understand the fundamentals of information systems and
                    critically assess their features and learn from case studies involving systems failures to design
                    purpose-built, successful object-oriented systems via UML diagrams. Such charts include sequence,
                    activity, entity relationship, and class diagrams. Thereafter, I learnt to appreciate the
                    object-oriented programming (OOP)-related principles and leveraged them to develop information
                    systems in both Python and SQL, including a doctorâ€™s surgery-related application. Throughout these
                    endeavours, I learnt how to design and develop object-oriented systems to streamline and inform
                    business decisions.</p>

                            instance, I wrote and shared a post with my colleagues with focus on a failure of an
                            AI-based system that was meant to guide investment decisions, and shared ideas on how such a
                            failure could have been avoided by design.</p>

                        <p>During this unit, I had the chance to apply OOP-related principles in Python further by
                            carrying out coding exercises on encapsulation, polymorphism, including operator overloading
                            for changing the behaviour of built-in Python functions to suit specific custom purposes,
                            and using private (class) attributes and methods. Building on my Java-related knowledge
                            about getters and setters, I had the opportunity to create them in Python in two ways, i.e.,
                            using property decorators and via the â€˜propertyâ€™ built-in function. The codes I developed
                            throughout these exercises can be accessed by clicking 'LEARN MORE' below.</p>

                            in the two previous units and learnt to appreciate UML and its principles at a deeper level.
                            Thus, I was able to slightly update and improve the supermarket-related UML class diagram,

                            Whilst the class diagram represents all classes in the proposed software system, the
                            sequence diagram illustrates the main steps involved in the process a patient must follow to
                            be able to book an appointment with a doctor. Instead, the activity diagram shows the
                            required checks and operations that a receptionist may perform to book an appointment for a
                            patient.</p>

                        <p>In this unit, I had the opportunity to create a UML 3NF-compliant <a

                                relationship diagram (ERD) on property lettings</a>, which represents the main relevant
                            entities (tables) and their relationships. I also completed an assignment on a software
                            system design to help in managing self-service checkouts at a supermarket, which involves a
                            related UML class diagram, including its classes and their relationships. Click on 'LEARN
                            MORE' below to view this assignment. In this instance, I learnt how to wear the userâ€™s
                            (customerâ€™s) hat and empathise with their pain points to drive the design of the information
                            system based on their needs and operations involved when scanning items at a self-service
                            checkout. This way of thinking enabled me to design the system such that the customerâ€™s
                            experience is as seamless as possible, from the start to the end of this process.
                            Furthermore, I appreciated the lecturerâ€™s feedback and leveraged it as an external reviewer
                            to improve the clarity of the relationships represented on the class diagram, as
                            demonstrated in subsequent unitsâ€™ artefacts, such as in unit 8.</p>

                        <p>Throughout this unit, I had the opportunity to learn web development using Flask in Python as

                                related exercises</a>. Furthermore, as an assignment, given a UML class diagram, I
                            implemented a Python-based software system focused on leveraging OOP-related design to help
                            in managing a doctorâ€™s surgeryâ€™s appointment schedulingâ€™s and prescriptionsâ€™ workflows,
                            which can be accessed by clicking 'LEARN MORE' below. In this instance, I practised further
                            on how to understand the patientâ€™s (userâ€™s) journey through the process of booking an
                            appointment and requesting a prescription at a doctorâ€™s surgery. By leveraging the UML class
                            diagram with the expected classes and their relationships, I could appreciate the various
                            interactions and constraints involved in such workflows, and how they can be represented via
                            an object-oriented design and implementation. Thus, I designed the application to leverage
                            OOP-related best practices to streamline the userâ€™s experience and ensure all business and
                            technical requirements were strictly adhered to.</p>

                            technologies to benefit society. Thus, I created a blog post on this theme, which you can
