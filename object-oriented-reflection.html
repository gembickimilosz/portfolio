                <h3>My Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    The module focus was mainly on the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). It also covered
                    its application in developing structured, scalable software systems using Python. Encapsulation,
                    inheritance, and polymorphism were key components of understanding how object-oriented design
                    principles can be practically applied to real-world problems. I explored system modelling using
                    Unified Modelling Language (UML), including developing class, activity, sequence, and state diagrams
                    that were utilised to visualise system functionality and component interactions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main part of the module was a practical project. I chose to design and implement software for a
                    humanoid robot assistant that works in a supermarket environment (Supermarket Helper Robot). It
                    focused on helping customers locate products, suggesting recipes based on their shopping basket, and
                    monitoring inventory levels. It also included a trigger that informed employees about necessary
                    restocking of products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I implemented it using Python and a JSON database, which was used to manage product and recipe data.
                    In addition to that, I applied various data structures such as lists (for storing recipe
                    ingredients), stacks (for tracking stock updates), and queues (to manage customer requests in
                    first-in, first-out order). These structures enabled the system to function efficiently while
                    ensuring modularity and maintainability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before developing the software, I created a series of UML diagrams to support the system design.
                    This ensured that all the robot’s behaviours, system flow, and class relationships were mapped ahead
                    of the development process. Both assignments required a design proposal and a working prototype that
                    demonstrated the use of OOP in solving a real-world problem. I approached that by refining each
                    component and using diagrams as my planning tools. I understood that diagrams help in ensuring
                    logical structure and system cohesion in any software.</p>

                <h3>Development and Learning Process</h3>
                <p>
                    This module surely contributed to my academic development. Before starting this module, I had not
                    been a confident Python user, as during my previous studies we focused mainly on Java. It gave me a
                    good overview of applying object-oriented programming concepts in a language that was completely new
                    to me. I was able to work on building my skills in creating UML diagrams. That knowledge certainly
                    helped me in visualising the system structure and translating it into functional Python software.
                    Over time, working on the Supermarket Helper Robot project helped me build confidence in using
                    various tools such as constructors, inheritance, abstract classes, and polymorphism in a coherent
                    way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I found the ThinkPython book particularly helpful in visualising complex concepts. Despite my ADHD
                    making traditional reading difficult, the book’s structure and exercises made the material
                    accessible and kept me engaged, reinforcing the module’s key learning outcomes through practical
                    examples (Downey, 2015).
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a personal level, there were moments of frustration. As a person with limited time, debugging
                    unexpected behaviours during the implementation phase was time-consuming. These obstacles were
                    emotionally taxing at times, although I pushed through and tried to motivate myself to persist and
                    refine my problem-solving skills. I believe that if one does not challenge themselves, they learn
                    less. Surprisingly, at one point I found that troubleshooting and optimising the logic of my code
                    became a genuine enjoyment. I was excited about identifying the error, looking for its cause, and
                    happily resolving it – a highly rewarding moment during programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also went through some of my colleagues’ posts in collaborative discussions. Their posts gave me
                    greater clarification on some theoretical elements, such as “Factors which Influence Reusability”
                    and “OO Design for IoT”. I truly enjoyed seeing the different approaches to those subjects from each
                    of the classmates. It helped me in understanding the content in a better way and contributed to
                    developing a more reflective mindset (The University of Edinburgh, 2021). Although the coding was an
                    independent task, I enjoyed engaging in more group work, which the collaborative discussions
                    provided.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Informed by literature such as Goodrich and Schultz’s (2007) work on human-robot interaction, I was
                    able to think more deeply about the user-facing aspects of the robot. Additionally, learning about
                    multiple design patterns from Gamma et al. (1994) influenced my structuring of class interactions. I
                    believe this blend of theory, application, and reflection has not only improved my technical
                    competence but also reshaped the way I approach system design - with a great focus on clarity, user
                    interaction, and sustainable development.
                </p>

                <h3>Going Forward</h3>
                <p>
                    The skills that I have gained from this module will surely play a crucial role in shaping my
                    development as a software developer. I believe I can now easily apply object-oriented programming
                    (OOP) and modular design in real-world projects. Because of the confidence I have gained with
                    Python, I plan to carry forward the momentum by integrating the learned principles into my future
                    professional and academic work. What I plan to take from this is the importance of UML models and
                    design patterns before writing any code. I have learned that the planning stage is not only
                    important for minimising errors but also for providing more clarity and scalability in development
                    tasks (Rolfe, Freshwater and Jasper, 2001).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have become more aware of the common problems in system design. The case study I conducted for the
                    development of my robot taught me to prioritise user needs, robust architecture, and maintainability
                    over quick implementation - something I had struggled with before. I recognise the importance of
                    clean code, adequate documentation, and thorough testing. By combining all of these, I know I can
                    deliver high-quality solutions in the environments I may work in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking ahead, I plan to revisit my work from my bachelor’s degree, which involved developing a
                    mental health chatbot. Unlike before - when I used JavaScript and struggled with code structure and
                    external libraries - I now feel confident building the next model using Python. I have learned the
                    basic concepts of programming in that language, which will enhance my previous study project.
                    Before, I was hesitant about programming the chatbot using Python, as I had not used the language
                    before and feared failure. Through personal research, I now know that its seamless integration with
                    tools like TensorFlow makes it a more accessible and powerful option for natural language processing
                    and machine learning integration. This will allow me to focus on delivering more meaningful
                    features, rather than spending time on syntax issues and the structural limitations of JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the long term, I aim to deepen my skills in Python and SQL through Codecademy. I will focus on
                    exploring areas like AI integration, human-centred design, and sustainable digital development. This
                    module has given me an amazing scale of practical and theoretical foundation to not only think
                    critically about system design, but also to build systems that truly matter.
                </p>
